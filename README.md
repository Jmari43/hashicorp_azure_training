# HashiCorp Azure Training Solutions
This branch includes solutions to each of the exercises. It's intended to allow the instructor to provide working examples to each exercise if the students are not able to solve the exercises independantly. It does not need to be secret, but it shouldn't be show to the students until after they have attempted the work on their own

## Instructor Prerequisites
1) The instructor needs to create a vault premium license which is valid for one week or less for any cluster id and save it to pastebin or some other area that it can be easily shared with the class.
2) The instructor to ensure that before the class begins the students all have working Azure Portal logins WITH THE ABILITY TO CREATE SERVICE PRINCIPALS.
3) The instructor should be very very clear to not commit terraform.tfstate to public version control. This course creates service principals which could be used to compromise an Azure account.

## Slides
The slides are only accessible to the instructor. If the class asks for it, PDF the slides and send seperately.
